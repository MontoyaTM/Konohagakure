Konohagakure is a Discord Bot created using DSharpPlus library, an unofficial .NET wrapper for the Discord API. The motivation for developing Konohagakure was to maintain community leadership, player applications, organize raids, retrieve real-time statistics, etc. for an MMORPG. The game discussed is NinOnline, a Ninja MMORPG featuring a large explorable world where players choose to align themselves within 3 ninja factions.

The project incorporates software programming concepts and problem solving using the Object Oriented Programming paradigm.

### Built With

* Visual Studio 2022
* DBeaver
* DSharpPlus
* Kuylar.DsharpPlus.ButtonCommands
* XeroxDev.DsharpPlus.ModalCommands

## Features

- [x] Villager Application
  
This feature requires players to complete a Villager Application to gain access to the Discord server. Players will fill out their response to the questions in a Discord Modal component. The data submitted will be saved in a database to create unique user profiles.

</div>

The application will then be sent to a private discord channel within the server, only accessible by the village Hokage and Council members. Within the channel, the Hokage or Councils will determine whether an individual will gain access. If the applicant is granted access, the roles (Villager) will be automatically given.
