# Konohagakure
Konohagakure is a Discord Bot created using DSharpPlus library, an unofficial .NET wrapper for the Discord API. The motivation for developing Konohagakure was to maintain community leadership, player applications, organize raids, retrieve real-time statistics, etc. for an MMORPG. The game discussed is NinOnline, a Ninja MMORPG featuring a large explorable world where players choose to align themselves within 3 ninja factions.

The project incorporates software programming concepts and problem solving using the Object Oriented Programming paradigm.
